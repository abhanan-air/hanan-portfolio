        <h3 style="color: #2980b9; font-size: 24px; margin-bottom: 12px;">🎯 Objective</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
            Addressed issues with query plans getting incorrect results due to large data updates and inserts in a high transactional IBM Informix 14 database. Implemented a strategy to ensure the optimizer follows consistent and efficient execution paths.

        <h3 style="color: #2980b9; font-size: 24px; margin-bottom: 12px;">🔧 Approach</h3>
        <div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
            <h4 style="color: #8e44ad; font-size: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;">📊 Statistics Management</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
                Implemented a comprehensive statistics management strategy by categorizing statistics into high, medium, and low priorities:
            </p>
            <ul style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; padding-left: 20px; list-style-type: disc; color: #2c3e50;">
                <li><strong>High Priority:</strong> Updated statistics for critical tables and indexes that are heavily used or affected by frequent transactions. This ensured that the optimizer had accurate and up-to-date information for key database operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Medium Priority:</strong> Updated statistics for tables and indexes that are important but not as critical as the high-priority ones. This balanced the need for accuracy with performance considerations.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Priority:</strong> Managed statistics for less frequently used tables and indexes, ensuring that updates did not overly impact database performance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
                Carefully considered the timing and impact of statistics updates to avoid disrupting ongoing transactions and to ensure minimal impact on overall system performance. Implemented strategies to schedule updates during low-usage periods or off-peak hours.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
                Monitored query performance and execution plans before and after the implementation of the updated statistics strategy. Verified that queries were executing with optimized plans and that performance improvements were achieved.
